## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla Javascript
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- React (https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt how to get data from an Api and how to work with global state which i want to improve and get better with.

### Continued development

Working with context API still not completely comfortable with and i will like to continue learnging to be confortable with and i will like to learn the techniques of not repeating the same logic in different components which I found useful that I want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - This helped me for configuring and use tailwind. I didn't take a tailwind course i just use the documentation.
